# What is this?
These are tools I made/make for the indie game Touhou 3D Dungeon. They're mostly tested on Linux, but may also work on Windows/macOS with the right tools.

# Files(to be expanded):
```unpack_audio.py -> Basically a hex dumper and byte swapper for the data files stored in /path/to/eData/4 and 5. This might work with the other files in the other folders, but I haven't tested it yet, and is currently hardcoded(terribly) to write .wav files.```

# Prequisites:
```
- unpack_audio.py:
  - vim (for xxd)
  - Python
  - Possibly Linux
```

# TODO:
- repacking script for dank mods
