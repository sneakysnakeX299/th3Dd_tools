# What is this?
These are tools I made/make for the indie game Touhou 3D Dungeon. They're mostly tested on Linux, but may also work on Windows/macOS with the right tools.

# Files(to be expanded):
```unpack_audio.py -> Basically a hex dumper and byte swapper for the data files stored in /path/to/eData/. Only WAV and X files are supported at the moment.```

# Prerequisites:
- unpack_audio.py:
  - vim (for xxd)
  - Python

# TODO:
- add support for nested directories
